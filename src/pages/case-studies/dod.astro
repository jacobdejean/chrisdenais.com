			The U.S. Department of Defense is America's largest government
			agency which provides the military forces needed to deter war and to
			protect the security of the United States. Our team at Crowdbotics
			worked on the

		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<p>
			Air Force pilots conduct post-flight debriefing sessions to assess
			their performance and mistakes, but analog tools such as whiteboards
			and writing notes hinders their ability to effectively learn from
			missions by relying on memory.

		<h2>Business goals</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Utilize avionics data collected on military aircraft</li>
			<li>
				Leverage AI for the identifying and grading of aerial maneuvers
			</li>
			<li>Plan for missions based on squadron or pilot proficiency</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>User interviews</h2>
		<p>
			I conducted interviews with 4 pilots stationed at Seymour Johnson
			Air Force Base to understand their work habits, pain points, and
			expectations of flight debriefing in a digital workspace. The pilots
			are familiar with their jargon and onboard flight instruments so
			they didnâ€™t want to relearn how to do simple things. Pilots wanted
			to know at a glance what maneuvers were flown and how well they
			performed each one.

		<blockquote>
			Typically at the end of the debrief the student keeps some notes,
			but we erase our tapes. We erase our shot sheets and all the data
			gets flushed.
